In case anyone reads this in the future, some context may be appreciated: I attended and (hopefully) completed this Master's program during the COVID-19 global pandemic from September 2020 to September 2021.

Thanks to everyone who taught me something during this program.

Thanks to those in the research group who helped me understand what a heme is and got me this far; they tolerated and attempted to alleviate my ignorance: Laura Tiessler Sala, José Emilio Sánchez Aparicio and JeanDi.

Thanks to the UAB for having me; and thanks to our professors for providing a mercilessly thorough education.

Thanks to Spain, and Catalonia, for even allowing me into the country, and, I emphasize, thanks for implementing public health measures.

Thanks to my classmates for also attempting to alleviate my gross incompetence and at least sharing in the suffering.

Thanks to my family and friends for supporting me, often over the phone, throughout this program and interesting time.

Thanks to whatever media I consumed and the creators of that media that facilitated the survival of my sanity through the pandemic.

Finally, I'd like to quote a well-known artist from California. He was referencing his own work, but I wholly identify with his appreciation for the subject of his esteem:

  "Last but not least, I wanna thank me. I wanna thank me for believing in me. I wanna thank me for doing all this hard work. I wanna thank me for having no days off. I wanna thank me for, for never quitting. I wanna thank me for always being a giver, and trying to give more than I receive. I wanna thank me for trying to do more right than wrong. I wanna thank me for just being me at all times."
