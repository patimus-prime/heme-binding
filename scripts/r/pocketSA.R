# 0. Notes on global variables...---------------------------

#may need to specify this option every run/change for running ALL PROCESSED FILES
#options(max.print = 999999999999999999999) #or whatever number


# 1. Assembling all results into one dataframe -----------------------------

#set working directory to the folder w files!
setwd("~/heme-binding/results/pocketSA")

# import all the shit that's been processed
# currently using results specific file, all of type .txt; therefore:
result_files_ls <- list.files(pattern = "*.pocketSA.txt") #double check what's up

# may need to add path = whatever from wd into the parentheses
# result_files_ls is now a list of all the fuckin txt files

# now read them from the list into a dataframe 
result_files_df <- lapply(result_files_ls, function(x) {read.delim(file = x, header = FALSE)})

# add source pdb column
result_files_df <- addpdbcol(result_files_df)

#i think each file now has its own dataframe. now we combine them
combined_results_df <- do.call("rbind", lapply(result_files_df, as.data.frame))
#@ line 981 (w/ orig PDBs, get an enormous volume. can either throw out this header, or filter as below)

# combined_results_df is now the final output of this section and the primary df
