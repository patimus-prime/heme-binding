# Conclusion {#conclusion}

<!-- If you want to include it:... -->
<!-- Thus, we confirm with (@Li2011) that the binding site for heme-b, and now additionally heme-c, is enriched with nonpolar amino acids. This strongly suggests that the nonpolar amino acids are crucial to the binding of heme, likely due to the favorable interaction between the nonpolar amino acids and the porphyrin ring of heme-b and heme-c. The degree to which the percentage of nonpolar acids in the binding pocket may affect the binding of heme cannot be determined in this analysis. But the agreement with the residues closest to heme (and therefore likely to coordinate) is discussed below. -->

A knowledge gap in the binding environment for heme exists in the present literature. A high-throughput framework employing UCSF Chimera  was constructed to process diverse sets of hemoproteins and output information about their binding pockets: amino acid frequencies and distances from heme, volume, surface area, angles. Data was gathered and predicted from representative and varied datasets for heme-b, heme-c, verdoheme, and siroheme, and their respective hemoproteins. R was used to analyze all data.

The results of this study are limited by the small sample size, but suggest that binding pockets for hemoproteins have some requirements for binding that may be overlooked, e.g. a high population of nonpolar amino acids for heme-b, heme-c, and verdoheme which may provide much of the interactions necessary to bind heme; in the case of siroheme there is a preponderance of polar amino acids. In either case both polar and nonpolar amino acids appear in force, suggesting both types of interactions are important to bind heme. Volumes are within reason. Surface area results reinforce, demonstrate the significance of the amino acid frequency results and show pockets have lesser or greater surface area depending on the involvemnt of covalent bonds or preferences for polar amino acids. Angular data, while not able to be interpreted into useful results, is produced and a framework provided for future study. 

These results may be useful in the rational design of hemoproteins in the future, with the importance of nonpolar interactions in particular likely of great interest. The framework constructed can be applied to any list of PDBs and their respective ligands, thereby facilitating similar research for other proteins.
