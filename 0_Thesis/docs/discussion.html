</h2>
<p>The first part of the study aimed at providing statistics on the amino acid propensity to interact with hemes in natural proteins. We started with heme-b, heme-c, siroheme and verdoheme. Because we are not looking only at the iron environment, but instead at the environment of the entire microcycle, we did the analysis for any amino acid in contact with the heme. This was done AA having at least one atom within the cutoff distances of 5 and 7 Angtroms (A). For the sake of this report, both sets of data are overlaid in the same figures in (section). However, the general tendencies are very similar and only the 7A data will be discussed.</p>
<p>For the main</p>
<p>Amino acid frequencies within the 5A and 7A distance cutoffs of the ligand are reported in Appendix <a href="a-figures.html#figs-aaFreq">A.1</a> and <strong>(FIXME! Missing amino acid tables)</strong></p>

<p>Interacts with the propionates, the polar groups within the porphyrin -
1.</p>
<p>Thus, we confirm with (<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Li2011" role="doc-biblioref">T. Li, Bonkovsky, and Guo</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-Li2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>) that the binding site for heme-b, and now additionally heme-c, is enriched with nonpolar amino acids. This strongly suggests that the nonpolar amino acids are crucial to the binding of heme, likely due to the favorable interaction between the nonpolar amino acids and the porphyrin ring of heme-b and heme-c. The degree to which the percentage of nonpolar acids in the binding pocket may affect the binding of heme cannot be determined in this analysis. But the agreement with the residues closest to heme (and therefore likely to coordinate) is discussed below.
<!-- FIXME: DO FUCKING DISCUSS IT -->
### Siroheme</p>
<p>The binding pocket for siroheme is highly enriched with arginine, in addition to other charged residues such as lysine and cysteine. Given the function of siroheme is to transfer multiple electrons per reaction, the enrichment of the binding environment with charged residues is perhaps not surprising. Addtionally, for siroheme in particular, the geometry, the placement of these residues in order to coordinate the movement of electrons may be of interest; however this is beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<div id="verdoheme" class="section level3" number="2.1.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Verdoheme<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#verdoheme"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Verdoheme is an intermediate formed within the binding pocket of heme oxygenase during the degradation of heme; this is the same environment that binds heme at the beginning of the reaction. Verdoheme is oriented differently in the pocket, however overall the amino acid composition of the pocket should be quite similar if not the same. But this is not reflected in our results. Rather, relative to the amino acid… profile (?) of heme-b and heme-c, arginine is in greater abundance in the binding pocket. Leucine, alanine and phenylalanine are still amongst the most frequent amino acids, again providing nonpolar interactions.</p>
<p>These results may suggest that verdoheme is reoriented, and potentially spatially relocated, to interact with more arginine residues than would be possible if the original heme orientation were maintained; the amount of space verdoheme would have to move within the binding pocket is discussed below. However, it is also possible, likely, this is an artefact of the very small sample size of verdoheme PDBs used in this study (n=4). Upon the availability of additional verdoheme-containing PDBs in the future this result may be reexamined.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Volume Discussion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#volume-discussion"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Figures can be found in Appendix <a href="a-figures.html#figs-vol">A.2</a>..</p>
<p>Besides HEM, much of the volume data for the different ligands did not closely agree between different distance cutoffs. The degree to which the method used to determine the volume of the binding pocket, Surfnet as implemented in UCSF Chimera, is affected by the distance cutoff is therefore demonstrated to be quite great. Most of the data did however fall within reasonable bounds, regardless of distance cutoffs.</p>
<p>Data for heme-b, heme-c and siroheme somewhat agree within a tight range of volumes, with heme-b in particular showing the best agreement of data at approximately 800-1200A³. However, the <em>range</em> of the volume data, for all ligands, is considerable, approximately 1000A³.</p>
<p>There are then at two conflicting conclusions from these data.</p>
<p>The the volumes of the binding pocket, as determined by calculation, are shown to not require uniform size. This suggests that the binding pocket need not be a perfect fit for each protein’s respective ligand. As far as implications for protein engineering, these results suggest that de novo design of a hemoprotein may not require significant work as far as sizing of a binding pocket.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the results demonstrate the difficulty of calculating molecular volumes, and how error-prone at least this method may be. Comparison with other methods of calculating molecular volumes, or with experimental data, would be warranted in future study.</p>
<p><strong>also need to highlight differences in excluded v. accessible</strong>
## Surface Area of Ligands
<!-- just combine 'em lol discussion will be the same -->
Figures can be found in Appendix <a href="a-figures.html#figs-ligExcSA">A.3</a> for ligands’ solvent excluded surface area, and
in Appendix <a href="a-figures.html#figs-ligAccSA">A.4</a> for ligands’ solvent accessible surface area.</p>
<p>This measure, and also the solvent accessible surface area of the ligands, is effectively of the surface area of each ligand itself - distance cutoffs and binding environments are not expected to affect the results. Significant variability in the data may therefore suggest problems in calculation.</p>
<p>Both accessible and excluded surface area data are fairly well centered around some value for all ligands, except for verdoheme. For the latter this may be attributed to the small sample size. But for other ligands, and also for verdoheme, the outliers in the data may suggest errors in calculation and potential inclusion of parts of the binding pocket itself in calculation.</p>

<p>These data, for all ligands, except potentially for heme-c, largely serve to compare as noise for the next section. The planar angles of all residues, falling within the upper distance cutoff of 7A, are plotted.</p>
<p>In the notable exception of heme-c (HEC), Figure <strong>FIXME: insert figure name</strong> for this ligand seems to suggest that GLU, MET and LYS have fairly specific planar angles with the ligand. However, heme-c is not coordinated to achieve its chemistry but rather covalently bound, to histidine. Lysine is effectively the median of amino acid frequency for heme-c, methionine is even less frequent and glutamine is the least frequent amino acid. For the latter two amino acids their tight range of planar angles is therefore likely an artefact of a small sample size of amino acids. However, for lysine the tight range of angles may be significant; this is dicussed further below.</p>
