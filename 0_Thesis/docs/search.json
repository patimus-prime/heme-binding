One ligand heme, complex iron porphyrin ring (go deeper porphyrins?). Heme employed many metalloproteins catalyze broad range reactions.Hemoglobin myoglboin likely familiar proteins, use heme store transport oxygen. examples enzymes employ heme peroxidases, catalases (type peroxidase), nitric oxide synthases, heme oxygenases, cytochrome p450s. Peroxidases catalases catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions using histidine-bound heme, catalases particular specializing decomposition hydrogen peroxide. Nitric oxide synthases catalyze reaction L-arginine nitric oxide, vitally important cellular signaling (Poulos (2014)). Free heme molecules may released upon degradation hemoproteins (especially hemoglobin), however, heme prooxidative therefore toxic cells must cleared. Heme oxygenases assist degradation heme, regarded potential therapeutics, due anti-inflammatory effects(Araujo, Zhang, Yin 2012).enzymes arguably potential applications, cytochrome P450s function powerful monooxygenases. participate many reactions: capable oxidizing wide range substrates, serving oxidize carbohydrates, steroids, fatty acids; catalyzing hormone degradation synthesis; degrading majority drugs(Poulos (2014)). Due extraordinary utility range reactions, cytochrome p450s great interest protein engineering field. Cytochrome P450s potential used industrial biocatalysis, e.g. pharmaceutical production, bioremediation environmental pollutants(Du et al. 2017; Lalonde 2016). limiting factor preventing deployment struggle increase enzymatic efficiency therefore yield processes employing enzyme(Girvan Munro 2016; Z. Li et al. 2020).Echoing many applications host enzymes, heme molecule variety. several “hemes,” structurally chemically different, used achieve different chemical reactions: study, examined heme-b, heme-c, siroheme, verdoheme. structures shown Figures 1-5.\nFigure 0.1: Heme-b (HEM)\n\nFigure 0.2: Heme-c (HEC)\n\nFigure 0.3: Siroheme (SRM)\n\nFigure 0.4: Verdoheme, VEA\n\nFigure 0.5: Verdoheme, VER\ncommon “heme,” heme-b, discussed . binds principally via noncovalent interactions binding pocket. Heme-c derived heme-b; binds, exceptions, covalently cysteine residues binding pocket, forming thioester bonds residues heme-c vinyl groups. function much specific heme-b, mostly serving elctron carrier. reason abundantly clear, several studies suggest covalent bonding, heme-c electronic potential broader specifiable heme-b. (Bowman Bren 2008; Kleingardner Bren 2015)Siroheme even limted applications arguably greater signifiance nature. used exclusively sulfite nitrite reductases, catalyze reduction sulfates nitrates plants uptake ground, ultimately use produce nitrogen sulfur-containing amino acids(Tripathy, Sherameti, Oelmüller (2010)). reason use siroheme reaction rather heme completely understood, one study suggests , along cofactors involved reaction, siroheme forms bridge catalyic iron atom porphyrin ring efficient channeling electrons bridge formed heme.(Brânzanic, Ryde, Silaghi-Dumitrescu 2019) FIXME DEFINITELY CUT WORDS.Lastly, verdoheme intermediate product degradation heme-b heme oxygenase. heme oxygenase degrades heme-b, biliverdin, carbon monoxide, iron produced; verdoheme precusor bilverdin(Lai et al. 2010; Sato et al. 2007). product prior reactions wthin heme oxygenase, verdoheme appears oriented bound differently (Lad, Ortiz De Montellano, Poulos 2004).\nsummary, heme molecules used many reactions several enzymes potential great value either biocatalysis pharmaceutical applications. multiple methods employed design molecules, rational design particular (basically, mutation certain residues based understanding structure-function relationships) least partially hampered incomplete understanding binding environment heme. importance binding environment noted study seeking design de novo heme-c based enzymes, found binding environment likely importance modulating redox potential (Ishida et al. 2004).fairly recent study conducted structural analysis 125 hemoprotein chains(T.
