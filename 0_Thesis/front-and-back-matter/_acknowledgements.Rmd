In case anyone reads this in the future, some context may be appreciated: I attended and completed this Master's during the COVID-19 global pandemic from September 2020 to September 2021.

Thanks professors

Thanks UAB

Thanks Spain, and Catalonia, allowing me in and then also having public health measures unlike Donny's America

Thanks classmates

Thanks fam, friends

Thanks to the media and the creators of media that facilitated the survival of my sanity through the pandemic.

Finally, I'd like to quote a well-known artist from California. He was referencing his own work, but I wholly identify with his appreciation for the subject of his esteem:

  "Last but not least, I wanna thank me. I wanna thank me for believing in me. I wanna thank me for doing all this hard work. I wanna thank me for having no days off. I wanna thank me for, for never quitting. I wanna thank me for always being a giver, and trying to give more than I receive. I wanna thank me for trying to do more right than wrong. I wanna thank me for just being me at all times."
