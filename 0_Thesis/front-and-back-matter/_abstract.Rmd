Hemoproteins are able to catalyze an extraordinarily broad range of reactions. This class of proteins includes cytochrome P450s and peroxidases, among many others. Hemoproteins by definition include heme to achieve their chemistry; but heme molecules themselves vary considerably, and different heme molecules are employed depending on the function of the hemoprotein. At present, there is a knowledge gap in the literature of the structural features required to bind heme in hemoprotein binding sites.

In this study, we investigated the binding environments of heme-b, heme-c, siroheme, and verdoheme. A high-throughput framework was developed to generate, process, and analyze data derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) files used in the study. Amino acid frequency, volume, surface areas, and angular relations within the heme binding sites were all examined for a diverse set of hemoproteins. Overall, we find that nonpolar residues and their interactions with heme may be of greater importance to heme binding than previously thought, suggesting that polar interactions, while necessary, are insufficient to efficiently bind heme. We also report several values for binding pocket volumes, surface areas, and angular data that may be of utility in artificial metalloenzyme design. The framework developed for this study is highly adaptable and may facilitate similar investigations for other proteins and ligands.
