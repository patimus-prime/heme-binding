abstract = {Biological systems rely on heme-proteins to carry out a number of basic functions essential for their survival. Hemes, or iron-porphyrin complexes, are the versatile and ubiquitous active centers of these proteins. In the past decade, discovery of new heme-proteins, together with functional and structural research, provided a wealth of information on these diverse and biologically important molecules. Structure determination work has shown that nature has used a variety of different scaffolds and architectures to bind heme and modulate functions such as redox properties. Structural data have also provided insights into the heme-linked protein conformational changes required in many regulatory heme-proteins. Remarkable efforts have been made towards the understanding of factors governing redox potentials. Site-directed mutagenesis studies and theoretical calculations on heme environments investigated the roles of hydrophobic and electrostatic residues, and analyzed the effect of heme solvent accessibility. This review focuses on the structure-function relationships underlying the association of heme in signaling and iron metabolism proteins. In addition, an account is given about molecular features affecting heme's redox properties; this briefly revisits previous conclusions in the light of some more recent reports. 271},

abstract = {Sulfite reductase (SiR) contains in the active site a unique assembly of siroheme and a [4Fe4S] cluster, linked by a cysteine residue. Siroheme is a doubly reduced variant of heme that is not used for a catalytic function in any other enzyme. We have used non-equilibrium Green's function methods coupled with density functional theory computations to explain why SiR employs siroheme rather than heme. The results show that direct, through vacuum, charge-transfer routes are inhibited when heme is replaced by siroheme. This ensures more efficient channelling of the electrons to the catalytic iron during the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide, limiting potential side-reactions that could occur if the incoming electrons were delocalized onto the macrocyclic ring.},

abstract = {Hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) are modified extracellular proteins, designed to replace or augment the oxygen-carrying capacity of erythrocytes. However, clinical results have generally been disappointing due to adverse side effects, in part linked to the intrinsic oxidative toxicity of Hb. Previously a redox-active tyrosine residue was engineered into the Hb $\beta$ subunit ($\beta$F41Y) to facilitate electron transfer between endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbate and the oxidative ferryl heme species, converting the highly oxidizing ferryl species into the less reactive ferric (met) form. We inserted different single tyrosine mutations into the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of Hb to determine if this effect of $\beta$F41Y was unique. Every mutation that was inserted within electron transfer range of the protein surface and the heme increased the rate of ferryl reduction. However, surprisingly, three of the mutations ($\beta$T84Y, $\alpha$L91Y and $\beta$F85Y) also increased the rate of ascorbate reduction of ferric(met) Hb to ferrous(oxy) Hb. The rate enhancement was most evident at ascorbate concentrations equivalent to that found in plasma (< 100 $\mu$M), suggesting that it might be of benefit in decreasing oxidative stress in vivo. The most promising mutant ($\beta$T84Y) was stable with no increase in autoxidation or heme loss. A decrease in membrane damage following Hb addition to HEK cells correlated with the ability of $\beta$T84Y to maintain the protein in its oxygenated form. When PEGylated and injected into mice, $\beta$T84Y was shown to have an increased vascular half time compared to wild type PEGylated Hb. $\beta$T84Y represents a new class of mutations with the ability to enhance reduction of both ferryl and ferric Hb, and thus has potential to decrease adverse side effects as one component of a final HBOC product.},

abstract = {Background: Heme is an essential molecule and plays vital roles in many biological processes. The structural determination of a large number of heme proteins has made it possible to study the detailed chemical and structural properties of heme binding environment. Knowledge of these characteristics can provide valuable guidelines in the design of novel heme proteins and help us predict unknown heme binding proteins. Results: In this paper, we constructed a non-redundant dataset of 125 heme-binding protein chains and found that these heme proteins encompass at least 31 different structural folds with all- class as the dominating scaffold. Heme binding pockets are enriched in aromatic and non-polar amino acids with fewer charged residues. The differences between apo and holo forms of heme proteins in terms of the structure and the binding pockets have been investigated. In most cases the proteins undergo small conformational changes upon heme binding. We also examined the CP (cysteine-proline) heme regulatory motifs and demonstrated that the conserved dipeptide has structural implications in protein-heme interactions. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed that heme binding pockets show special features and that most of the heme proteins undergo small conformational changes after heme binding, suggesting the apo structures can be used for structure-based heme protein prediction and as scaffolds for future heme protein design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The least understood mechanism during heme degradation by the enzyme heme oxygenase (HO) is the third step of ring opening of verdoheme to biliverdin, a process which maintains iron homeostasis. In response to this mechanistic uncertainty, we launched a combined study of X-ray crystallography and theoretical QM/MM calculations, designed to elucidate the mechanism. The air-sensitive ferrous verdoheme complex of HmuO, a heme oxygenase from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, was crystallized under anaerobic conditions. Spectral analysis of the azide-bound verdoheme-HmuO complex crystals assures that the verdoheme group remains intact during the crystallization and X-ray diffraction measurement. The structure offers the first solid evidence for the presence of a water cluster in the distal pocket of this catalytically critical intermediate. The subsequent QM/MM calculations based on this crystal structure explore the reaction mechanisms starting from the FeOOH-verdoheme and FeHOOH-verdoheme complexes, which mimic, respectively, the O2-and H2O2-supported degradations. In both mechanisms, the rate-determining step is the initial O-O bond breaking step, which is either homolytic (for FeHOOH-verdoheme) or coupled to electron and proton transfers (in FeOOH-verdoheme). Additionally, the calculations indicate that the FeHOOH-verdoheme complex is more reactive than the FeOOH-verdoheme complex in accord with experimental findings. QM energies with embedded MM charges are close to and yield the same conclusions as full QM/MM energies. Finally, the calculations highlight the dominant influence of the distal water cluster which acts as a biocatalyst for the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin in the two processes, by fixing the departing OH and directing it to the requisite site of attack, and by acting as a proton shuttle and a haven for the highly reactive OH- nucleophile. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

P450s are considered as the most versatile biocatalysts in nature because of the vast variety of substrate structures and the types of reactions they catalyze. In particular, P450s can catalyze regio- and stereoselective oxidations of nonactivated C–H bonds in complex organic molecules under mild conditions, making P450s useful biocatalysts in the production of commodity pharmaceuticals, fine or bulk chemicals, bioremediation agents, flavors, and fragrances. Major efforts have been made in engineering improved P450 systems that overcome the inherent limitations of the native enzymes. In this review, we focus on recent progress of different strategies, including protein engineering, redox-partner engineering, substrate engineering, electron source engineering, and P450-mediated metabolic engineering, in efforts to more efficiently produce pharmaceuticals and other chemicals.

abstract = {Heme oxygenase oxidatively degrades heme to biliverdin resulting in the release of iron and CO through a process in which the heme participates both as a cofactor and substrate. One of the least understood steps in the heme degradation pathway is the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin. In order to obtain a better understanding of this step we report the crystal structures of ferrous-verdoheme and, as a mimic for the oxy-verdoheme complex, ferrous-NO verdoheme in a complex with human HO-1 at 2.20 and 2.10 {\AA}, respectively. In both structures the verdoheme occupies the same binding location as heme in heme-HO-1, but rather than being ruffled verdoheme in both sets of structures is flat. Both structures are similar to their heme counterparts except for the distal helix and heme pocket solvent structure. In the ferrous-verdoheme structure the distal helix moves closer to the verdoheme, thus tightening the active site. NO binds to verdoheme in a similar bent conformation to that found in heme-HO-1. The bend angle in the verodoheme-NO structure places the terminal NO oxygen 1 {\AA} closer to the $\alpha$-meso oxygen of verdoheme compared to the $\alpha$-meso carbon on the heme-NO structure. A network of water molecules, which provide the required protons to activate the iron-oxy complex of heme-HO-1, is absent in both ferrous-verdoheme and the verdoheme-NO structure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {ConspectusHemes are ubiquitous in biology and carry out a wide range of functions. The heme group is largely invariant across proteins with different functions, although there are a few variations seen in nature. The most common variant is heme c, which is formed by a post-translational modification in which heme is covalently linked to two Cys residues on the polypeptide via thioether bonds. In this Account, the influence of this covalent attachment on heme c properties and function is discussed, and examples of how covalent attachment has been used in selected applications are presented.Proteins that bind heme c are among the most well-characterized proteins in biochemistry. Most of these proteins are cytochromes c (cyts c) that serve as electron carriers in photosynthesis and respiration. Despite the intense study of cyts c, the functional significance of heme covalent attachment has remained elusive. One observation is that heme c reaches a lower reduction potential in nature than its noncovalently linked counterpart, heme b, when comparing proteins with the same axial ligands. Furthermore, covalent attachment is known to enhance protein stability and allow the heme to be relatively solvent exposed. However, an inorganic chemistry perspective on the effects of covalent attachment has been lacking. Spectroscopic measurements and computations on cyts c and model systems reveal a number of effects of covalent attachment on heme electronic structure and reactivity. One is that the predominant nonplanar ruffling distortion seen in heme c lowers heme reduction potential. Another is that covalent attachment influences the interaction of the heme iron with the proximal His ligand. Heme ruffling also has been shown to influence electronic coupling to redox partners and, therefore, electron transfer rates by altering the distribution of the orbital hole on the porphyrin in oxidized cyt c. Another consequence of heme covalent attachment is the strong vibrational coupling seen between the iron and the protein surface as revealed by nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy studies. Finally, heme covalent attachment is proposed to be an important feature supporting multiple roles of cyt c in programmed cell death (apoptosis).Heme covalent attachment is not only vital for the biological functions of cyt c but also provides a useful handle in a number of applications. For one, the engineering of heme c onto an exposed portion of a protein of interest has been shown to provide a visible affinity purification tag. In addition, peptides with covalently attached heme, known as microperoxidases, have been studied as model compounds and oxidation catalysts and, more recently, in applications for energy conversion and storage. The wealth of insight gained about heme c through fundamental studies of cyts c forms a basis for future efforts toward engineering natural and artificial cytochromes for a variety of applications.},

Across Nature, their substrate range is vast and exceeds that of other enzymes. The range of different chemical transformations performed by P450s is also substantial, and continues to expand through interrogation of the properties of novel P450s and by protein engineering studies. The ability of P450s to introduce oxygen atoms at specific positions on complex molecules makes these enzymes particularly valuable for applications in synthetic biology. This review focuses on the enzymatic properties and reaction mechanisms of P450 enzymes, and on recent studies that highlight their broad applications in the production of oxychemicals. For selected soluble bacterial P450s (notably the high-activity P450-cytochrome P450 reductase enzyme P450 BM3), variants with a multitude of diverse substrate selectivities have been generated both rationally and by random mutagenesis/directed evolution approaches. This highlights the robustness and malleability of the P450 fold, and the capacity of these biocatalysts to oxidise a wide range of chemical scaffolds. This article reviews recent research on the application of wild-type and engineered P450s in the production of important chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and drug metabolites, steroids and antibiotics.

abstract = {The heme oxygenase (HO) reaction consists of three successive oxygenation reactions, i.e. heme to $\alpha$-hydroxyheme, $\alpha$-hydroxyheme to verdoheme, and verdoheme to biliverdin-iron chelate. Of these, the least understood step is the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin-iron chelate. For the cleavage of the oxaporphyrin ring of ferrous verdoheme, involvement of a verdoheme $\pi$-neutral radical has been proposed. To probe this hypothetical mechanism in the HO reaction, we performed electrochemical reduction of ferrous verdoheme complexed with rat HO-1 under anaerobic conditions. On the basis of the electrochemical spectral changes, the midpoint potential for the one-electron reduction of the oxaporphyrin ring of ferrous verdoheme was found to be -0.47 ± 0.01 V vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Because this potential is far lower than those of both flavins of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and of NADPH, it is concluded that the one-electron reduction of the oxaporphyrin ring of ferrous verdoheme is unlikely to occur and that the formation of the $\pi$-neutral radical cannot be the initial step in the degradation of verdoheme by HO. Rather, it appears more reasonable to consider an alternative mechanism in which binding of O2 to the ferrous iron of verdoheme is the first step in the degradation of verdoheme. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Siroheme is the central cofactor in a conserved class of sulfite and nitrite reductases that catalyze the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonia. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, siroheme is produced by a trifunctional enzyme, siroheme synthase (CysG). A bifunctional active site that is distinct from its methyltransferase activity catalyzes the final two steps, NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation and iron chelation. How this active site performs such different chemistries is unknown. Here, we report the structures of CysG bound to precorrin-2, the initial substrate; sirohydrochlorin, the dehydrogenation product/chelation substrate; and a cobalt-sirohydrochlorin product. We identified binding poses for all three tetrapyrroles and tested the roles of specific amino acids in both activities to give insights into how a bifunctional active site catalyzes two different chemistries and acts as an iron-specific chelatase in the final step of siroheme synthesis.},

abstract = {Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process of the vascular wall characterized by the infiltration of lipids and inflammatory cells. Oxidative modifications of infiltrating low-density lipoproteins and induction of oxidative stress play a major role in lipid retention in the vascular wall, uptake by macrophages and generation of foam cells, a hallmark of this disorder. The vasculature has a plethora of protective resources against oxidation and inflammation, many of them regulated by the Nrf2 transcription factor. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a Nrf2-regulated gene that plays a critical role in the prevention of vascular inflammation. It is the inducible isoform of HO, responsible for the oxidative cleavage of heme groups leading to the generation of biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and release of ferrous iron. HO-1 has important antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiapoptotic, antiproliferative, and immunomodu-latory effects in vascular cells, most of which play a significant role in the protection against atherogenesis. HO-1 may also be an important feature in macrophage differentiation and polarization to certain subtypes.The biological effects of HO-1 are largely attributable to its enzymatic activity, which can be conceived as a system with three arms of action, corresponding to its three enzymatic byproducts. HO-1 mediated vascular protection may be due to a combination of systemic and vascular local effects. It is usually expressed at low levels but can be highly upregulated in the presence of several proatherogenic stimuli. The HO-1 system is amenable for use in the development of new therapies, some of them currently under experimental and clinical trials. Interestingly, in contrast to the HO-1 antiatherogenic actions, the expression of its transcriptional regulator Nrf2 leads to proatherogenic effects instead. This suggests that a potential intervention on HO-1 or its byproducts may need to take into account any potential alteration in the status of Nrf2 activation. This article reviews the available evidence that supports the antiatherogenic role of HO-1 as well as the potential pathways and mechanisms mediating vascular protection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Araujo, Zhang and Yin.},

abstract = {Selective oxidation of aliphatic C-H bonds in alkylphenols serves significant roles not only in generation of functionalized intermediates that can be used to synthesize diverse downstream chemical products, but also in biological degradation of these environmentally hazardous compounds. Chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity; controllability; and environmental impact represent the major challenges for chemical oxidation of alkylphenols. Here, we report the development of a unique chemomimetic biocatalytic system originated from the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum. The system consisting of CreHI (for installation of a phosphate directing/ anchoring group), CreJEF/CreG/CreC (for oxidation of alkylphenols), and CreD (for directing/anchoring group offloading) is able to selectively oxidize the aliphatic C-H bonds of p-And m-Alkylated phenols in a controllable manner. Moreover, the crystal structures of the central P450 biocatalyst CreJ in complex with two representative substrates provide significant structural insights into its substrate flexibility and reaction selectivity.},

abstract = {Background: Heme is an essential molecule and plays vital roles in many biological processes. The structural determination of a large number of heme proteins has made it possible to study the detailed chemical and structural properties of heme binding environment. Knowledge of these characteristics can provide valuable guidelines in the design of novel heme proteins and help us predict unknown heme binding proteins. Results: In this paper, we constructed a non-redundant dataset of 125 heme-binding protein chains and found that these heme proteins encompass at least 31 different structural folds with all- class as the dominating scaffold. Heme binding pockets are enriched in aromatic and non-polar amino acids with fewer charged residues. The differences between apo and holo forms of heme proteins in terms of the structure and the binding pockets have been investigated. In most cases the proteins undergo small conformational changes upon heme binding. We also examined the CP (cysteine-proline) heme regulatory motifs and demonstrated that the conserved dipeptide has structural implications in protein-heme interactions. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed that heme binding pockets show special features and that most of the heme proteins undergo small conformational changes after heme binding, suggesting the apo structures can be used for structure-based heme protein prediction and as scaffolds for future heme protein design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Natural c-type cytochromes are characterized by the consensus Cys-X-X-Cys-His heme-binding motif (where X is any amino acid) by which the heme is covalently attached to protein by the addition of the sulfhydryl groups of two cysteine residues to the vinyl groups of the heme. In this work, the consensus sequence was used for the heme-binding site of a designed four-helix bundle, and the apoproteins with either a histidine residue or a methionine residue positioned at the sixth coordination site were synthesized and reacted with iron protoporphyrin IX (protoheme) under mild reducing conditions in vitro. These polypeptides bound one heme per helix-loop-helix monomer via a single thioether bond and formed four-helix bundle dimers in the holo forms as designed. They exhibited visible absorption spectra characteristic of c-type cytochromes, in which the absorption bands shifted to lower wavelengths in comparison with the b-type heme binding intermediates of the same proteins. Unexpectedly, the designed cytochromes c with bis-His-coordinated heme iron exhibited oxidation-reduction potentials similar to those of their b-type intermediates, which have no thioether bond. Furthermore, the cytochrome c with His and Met residues as the axial ligands exhibited redox potentials increased by only 15-30 mV in comparison with the cytochrome with the bis-His coordination. These results indicate that highly positive redox potentials of natural cytochromes c are not only due to the heme covalent structure, including the Met ligation, but also due to noncovalent and hydrophobic environments surrounding the heme. The covalent attachment of heme to the polypeptide in natural cytochromes c may contribute to their higher redox potentials by reducing the thermodynamic stability of the oxidized forms relatively against that of the reduced forms without the loss of heme.},
