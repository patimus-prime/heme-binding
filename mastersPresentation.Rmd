# Introduction

# Heme

Hemoprotein = Any protein containing a heme, used for its chemistry

Heme = A group of 
- something
  - another something

---
# Hemoproteins

Hemoproteins encompass a broad range of enzyzmes:
--


Peroxidases and Catalases
- Oxidation-reduction (Redox) reactions

--

**Sulfite and Nitrite Reductases**
- Unique reaction *channeling* many electrons at once

--

**Heme Oxygenases!** 
- Degradation of heme released from digestion of hemoproteins

--

Cytochrome P450s
- Monooxygenases; insertion of oxygen into molecules
- *EXTREMELY USEFUL!!*

---

# Cytochrome P450s

Physiological Importance:
- Hormone degradation and synthesis
- Degrade the majority of all drugs! `r Citet(myBib,"Poulos2014")`

<!-- `r Citet(myBib, "Sanner1996")` -->

**Oxidize**:
- Carbohydrates
- Steroids
- Fatty Acids

--

And therefore, can be applied to many other oxidation reactions with stable substrates!!!


carbohydrates, steroids, fatty acids; catalyzing hormone degradation and synthesis; and degrading the majority of drugs[@Poulos2014]. Due to their extraordinary utility and range of reactions, cytochrome p450s are of great interest in the protein engineering field. Cytochrome P450s have the potential to be used  in industrial biocatalysis, e.g. in pharmaceutical production, bioremediation of environmental pollutants[@Du2017; @Lalonde2016]. The limiting factor preventing its deployment has been the struggle to increase enzymatic efficiency and therefore yield of processes employing the enzyme[@Girvan2016; @Li2020].

Beginning at the left of Figure \@ref(fig:HEM-AAfreq) and moving right, large, nonpolar amino acids appear most frequently within 7A: LEU and PHE; ILE appears less frequently than these two amino acids but nonetheless is in high frequency. Small, nonpolar amino acids ALA and VAL also appear very frequently. As the majority of the heme-b molecule is made up of the nonpolar porphyrin ring, these amino acids are therefore likely in such high frequency to provide the nonpolar interactions with the pyrole groups and methyl and vinyl groups.

Tyrosine, arginine, histidine appear next most frequently. The two propionate groups on heme make polar interactions with salt bridges formed between arginine groups within the binding environment[@Barrows2005]. Therefore, the tyrosine and histidine likely form polar interactions with the portion of the propionate groups not interacting with the arginine salt bridges. This, in addition to the nonpolar interactions above, likely provides as hospitable of a binding environment as possible to coordinate the heme. It should be noted histidine is one of the residues that coordinates the iron atom, and this may therefore increase its frequency in the binding pocket.

Glycine is a small residue and cannot form significant interactions within its environment; however, its frequency, or lack thereof (compared to background frequency, discussed below), suggests the binding pocket may not require as much flexibility or spatial considerations as in the rest of the protein.

Next appear serine, glutamate (glutamic acid) and aspartate (aspartic acid) and lysine. These are polar residues, and glutamate and aspartate are negatively charged; lysine is polar too, but positively charged (at pH 7). The negative charge on glutamate and aspartate may explain why they are fairly infrequent: although polar, the negative charge may induce a repulsion effect with the propionate groups. Or, it may be that other amino acids are preferable, as is likely the case for lysine. Lysine is polar and positively charged; but arginine residues forms the salt bridges necessary for propionate to make polar interactions. And histidine coordinates the heme iron. Therefore the infrequency of lysine may be less due to a problem with lysine and more due to a preference for other polar amino acids.

Proline is a small nonpolar amino acid in low frequency; the trend for heme-b, at least, appears to be to favor large nonpolar amino acids in the binding pocket. This may suggest that a large amount of nonpolar interactions, per residue, is favored in the binding pocket, perhaps because of the limited space available to position residues to interact with heme.

Asparagine and glutamine are both medium-sized polar amino acids; given the trends already discussed it is surprising these are not in greater abundance. But as with proline, it may simply be a matter of maximizing the benefit of the interactions that may be formed with the heme; while asparagine and glutamine are polar, amino acids like arginine and histidine are both polar and positively charged (and arginine forms salt bridges), capable of stronger interactions with the electronegative propionate groups.

Methionine and tryptophan appear very infrequently in the binding pocket. Tryptophan is very surprising to find as second-to-least frequent. It is a large nonpolar amino acid - but perhaps its single, potential hydrogen bond, although weak, is enough to prefer completely nonpolar residues. Or, with its size, it is preferable to have more numerous, smaller nonpolar residues that can favorably interact with the porphyrin while reducing steric hindrance of other residues in the environment. The reason for methionine's low frequency is not clear, perhaps for similar reasons as with proline, where more intensely nonpolar residues are preferred, rather than less nonpolar residues being unfavorable.

Cystine appears most infrequently of all the amino acids in the binding pocket. This is quite  surprising - cystine is the other highly conserved residue that may coordinate the heme iron. Perhaps the sample of PDBs used in this study mostly use histidine to coordinate the iron - but this would only account for one residue in the binding pocket per pdb. Therefore these results suggest that while cystidine may be well suited to coordinate the iron in heme, it is poorly suited to form any nonpolar interactions with the porphyrin ring, leaving the task up to other, more suitably, intensely nonpolar amino acids.

Moving away from discussing individual amino acid populations, what is especially notable of the data for heme-b is that nonpolar residues appear in much greater frequency than polar residues. Nonpolar interactions with heme are therefore more numerous than polar interactions. Their multiplicity may also suggest that they are potentially of greater importance than previously thought. At the very least, these results suggest that polar interactions and coordination of the iron atom, while necessary for heme binding, are insufficient, and that nonpolar interactions and the population of nonpolar residues in the binding pocket should be considered when examining the binding environment of heme.

# Comparison with Background Amino Acid Frequencies

While the frequencies of amino acids in the binding pocket have been discussed, it may also be of interest to compare against the background amino acid frequency, the general frequency of amino acids within the entire monomer. The degree to which any results may affect the significance of the frequencies of the amino acids in the binding pocket is unclear - those amino acids are interacting with the heme. However, an in depth examination of similarities and differences may reveal that some amino acids may simply be extremely highly conserved by chance and by virtue of their numerous population, rather than some chemical benefit.

      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)))

```


Leucine and alanine, as in the binding pocket frequencies, are highly frequent in the overall monomer. This may suggest their prevalence in the binding pocket may simply be due to a high population of leucine and alanine in hemoproteins.

However, after these two amino acids the tendencies in frequency for the binding pocket and the monomer at large diverge. Glycine is in high frequency - likely due to more complex geometry e.g. helices outside the binding pocket. In interest of brevity, the remaining frequencies are summed up thus: the same trends that appear to exist in the binding pocket do not appear to exist in the monomer at large. While the order of frequencies in conserved binding pockets can be rationalized, justifying the overall frequencies in monomers invites significant speculation.

<!-- After an exhaustive exploration of the relative frequencies of amino acids in the binding pocket, Figure \@ref(fig:HEM-AAdist) below is fairly straightfoward. It plots the distribution of amino acids in the binding pocket against their distance from the iron of the heme.  -->

We find that only a few residues come in close contact (<4A) of the heme: cysteine, histidine, and tyrosine. Most residues center their distribution at around 6A, although lysine seems more biased than the remaining residues to be a bit closer. Cysteine and histidine may be at least in part explained to be close due to their use as coordinating residues; histidine, being in greater frequency, may also be this close due to favorable interactions with the porphyrin ring. 

The proximity of tyrosine  however, is more notable. It cannot form coordination bonds with the heme iron, but tyrosine residues do interact with the propionate groups. Tyrosine is also required for redox reactions, and part of the population of tyrosine residues may therefore be in close proximity to heme to facilitate electron transfer in various enzymes [@Poulos2014]. These results suggest that of all potentially interacting polar/positively charged residues, tyrosine is the most likely at least to be in close proximity to the heme molecule. Whether this illustrates an importance of tyrosine to interact with propionate groups, or instead the need for tyrosine to be in close proximity in order to form such interactions, or simply demonstrates involvement in oxidation/reduction reactions, is beyond the scope of this study.

```

Leucine and alanine again are highly frequent for HEC, followed by quite similar trends, and therefore HEC will not be as thoroughly discussed as HEM. The most notable differences may be that GLY and CYS are in far higher frequency than in heme. Heme-c almost always forms covalent bonds with cysteine residues, and this may explain that frequency. But as for the high frequency of glycine, the reason for its abundance is unclear, although it seems it may have an important role in heme-c pockets. 

Lys was overlooked in the thesis also - oops lol. But anyway, LYS is a weakly polar, positively charged thing. It also has propionate groups to bind to - it may be that a weaker polar residue is fine when there's a covalent bond, but this is in high frequency. This may indicate a specialized role for Lys in HEC binding.

```

Generally, the heme-c monomer AA frequency profile appears similar to the heme-b monomer, with a high frequency of alanine and leucine, followed by a divergence in the frequency of amino acids and therefore a struggle to form any meaningful discussion when it comes to comparing the binding pocket frequencies against background frequencies.

The distribution of amino acids over distance from the heme iron for HEC is similar to HEM, with some exceptions. Cys, His, Tyr again are amongst the closest residues to HEC, likely for the same reasons of very strong polar interactions or coordination. Additionally, cysteine forms covalent, thioether bonds with heme-c, providing further justification for its proximity. However, for heme-c, lysine and methionine also are very proximal. The methionine residues are nonpolar, small, neutral; lysine is polar and positively charged; neither of these residues are favored to be included in the heme-b binding environment despite very similar structures. The reason for their inclusion so close to the binding pocket is therefore unclear, but based on their distribution, and lysine being even more close proximity than heme, the results suggest these two residues may have important roles.

The frequqency of amino acids in the binding pocket for verdoheme is dissimilar from heme-b and heme-c above. This is fairly surprising, given that verdoheme is an intermediate in the binding pocket for heme-b within heme oxygenases. 

<!-- The results discussed below may be attributable to the small sample size of verdoheme PDBs (n=4, combining VEA and VER), and should be appreciated with some skepticism. Nonetheless, the results will be discussed. -->

Leucine and alanine are again most frequent, but after these, results diverge. Tyrosine and arginine are next most frequent - surprising, given that this is still the same pocket that bound heme-b. The data for heme-b indicate more frequent nonpolar residues before tyrosine. Chemically, it may be that as heme-b is oxidized, there is greater need for polar interactions; this would help to explain the high frequency of polar residues, but does not explain the shift in amino acid frequencies within what would be expected to be a similar binding pocket - all verdoheme PDBs in this in study were sourced from heme oxgenase proteins. Some heme oxygenases are included for heme-b, but they are amongst a diverse set of proteins. Therefore, the heme oxygenase environment may simply be host to more polar residues than normal for hemoproteins. This also agrees with tyrosine's inclusion in redox reactions, and it may be favored to be present in heme oxygenase. These results indicate more about the heme oxygenase environment than the verdoheme binding environment - however, these two are inseparable, given verdoheme only appears in heme oxygenase. A dedicated investigation to the heme binding environment for heme oxygenase, may therefore be warranted in future study. 

Glycine is the next most frequent - it is in lower frequency, relatively, for heme-b. As with other heme molecules, it is not clear as to what the role of glycine is in binding verdoheme.

```

Besides the frequencies of leucine and alanine, which have been found for heme-b and heme-c above to be highly frequent in hemoproteins at large, the frequency profiles for the verdoheme binding environment and monomers is shown to be quite dissimilar, supporting the results for the binding environment as unique, not simply due to background frequency.

# Distributon of Amino Acids by Distance

The low sample size for verdoheme leads here to a poor figure with few residues plotted. This is likely attributable to an insufficient amount of distances and residues to cross-reference against each other, an operation that successfully occurs for all similar graphs. Regardless, the data that are plotted will be discussed.

The highly conserved histidine for hemoproteins is exclusively within 5A for verdoheme. This result again suggests that at least some of the data for verdoheme may be highly biased because of the small sample size - heme-b data included a greater range for histidine. Or, perhaps for heme oxygenases heme is solely present to coordinate the iron atom, leading to all His residues being nearby verdoheme. The close proximity of glycine to verdoheme is also unexpected and unable to be explained without further study. The remainder of the residues plotted appear to follow the trends seen in for the other types of heme, with distance values centered around 6A and unremarkable distributions.

Siroheme, with a structure highly dissimilar to the other heme molecules examined, should be expected to have a different amino acid frequency profile -- and indeed we confirm this in our results. 

Nonpolar residues are not the  most abundant in the siroheme binding pocket. In fact, disproportionately frequent to the rest of the residues in the binding pocket is arginine. Siroheme is saturated with carboxyl and propionate groups; the entire porphyrin ring surrounded by polar, electronegative groups. And therefore a polar, positively charged amino acid such as arginine is reasonable to expect in the binding pocket -- what is striking, however is the extreme preference for arginine; such a profile does not exist for the other types of heme. This can be at least explained; siroheme contains propionate groups that likely still form polar interactions with arginine salt bridges, and the carboxyl groups may also form polar interactions with arginine, therefore highly favoring arginine's presence in the binding pocket.

Arginine is followed by other polar amino acids: glutamine, cystine, lysine, threonine, and asparagine; a more homogenous trend than seen for the other heme molecules, in that the trend is not interrupted by residues of opposing polarity as for other types of heme. Though these results could be expected, they demonstrate the extent to which siroheme's binding pocket is dominated by polar residues. The preference for arginine out of all polar amino acids may be attributed to its positive charge, and ability to form salt bridges that interact with the propionate groups; lysine also has a positive charge and is polar, but does not form salt bridge interactions with the propionate  groups. Cysteine is used to coordinate the iron of siroheme, and while this did not significantly affect the frequency for other heme molecules, it is still possible this increases the value for cysteine for siroheme.

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>

--

- Click the `Knit` button to compile it;

--

- or use the [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)<sup>2</sup> "Infinite Moon Reader" to live preview the slides (every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

# Hello Ninja

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# remark.js

You can see an introduction of remark.js from [its homepage](https://remarkjs.com). You should read the [remark.js Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) at least once to know how to

- create a new slide (Markdown syntax<sup>*</sup> and slide properties);

- format a slide (e.g. text alignment);

- configure the slideshow;

- and use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).

It is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in **xaringan**.

.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc's Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on... You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js [may be improved](https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/142) in the future.]

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

Provides an R Markdown output format `xaringan::moon_reader` as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "A Cool Presentation"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo: true
    nature:
      autoplay: 30000
---
```

See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for all possible options that you can use.

---

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;
]

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')
grep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```

---

# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

# HTML Widgets

I have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against **xaringan**. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.

Similarly, the Shiny mode (`runtime: shiny`) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.

See the next page for two HTML widgets.

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)
```

---

```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE}
DT::datatable(
  head(iris, 10),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```

---

# Some Tips

- Do not forget to try the `yolo` option of `xaringan::moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        yolo: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- Slides can be automatically played if you set the `autoplay` option under `nature`, e.g. go to the next slide every 30 seconds in a lightning talk:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay: 30000
    ```

- If you want to restart the play after it reaches the last slide, you may set the sub-option `loop` to TRUE, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay:
            interval: 30000
            loop: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- A countdown timer can be added to every page of the slides using the `countdown` option under `nature`, e.g. if you want to spend one minute on every page when you give the talk, you can set:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          countdown: 60000
    ```

    Then you will see a timer counting down from `01:00`, to `00:59`, `00:58`, ... When the time is out, the timer will continue but the time turns red.
    
---

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---

# Some Tips


.pull-left[
An example using a leading `*`:

    ```r
    if (TRUE) {
    ** message("Very important!")
    }
    ```
Output:
```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!")
}
```

This is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed.
]

.pull-right[
An example using `{{}}`:

````
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
*{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```
````
Output:
```{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```

It is valid R code so you can run it. Note that `{{}}` can wrap an R expression of multiple lines.
]

---

# Some Tips

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:

````markdown
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
````

Output:

```{r tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```

---

# Some Tips

When you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines, and `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.

````md
`r ''````{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}
head(iris)
```
````

```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

Question: what does `highlight.output = c(TRUE, FALSE)` mean? (Hint: think about R's recycling of vectors)

---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

---

# Macros

- remark.js [allows users to define custom macros](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/80) (JS functions) that can be applied to Markdown text using the syntax `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...]` or `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...](this)`. For example, before remark.js initializes the slides, you can define a macro named `scale`:

    ```js
    remark.macros.scale = function (percentage) {
      var url = this;
      return '<img src="' + url + '" style="width: ' + percentage + '" />';
    };
    ```

    Then the Markdown text

    ```markdown
    ![:scale 50%](image.jpg)
    ```

    will be translated to
    
    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 50%" />
    ```

---

# Macros (continued)

- To insert macros in **xaringan** slides, you can use the option `beforeInit` under the option `nature`, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          beforeInit: "macros.js"
    ```

    You save your remark.js macros in the file `macros.js`.

- The `beforeInit` option can be used to insert arbitrary JS code before `remark.create()`. Inserting macros is just one of its possible applications.

---

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a dōjutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ /ʃ/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan) (写輪眼; the package name)

- The [moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (月読; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra) (查克拉; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (性質変化; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (無限月読; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.
