Here we'll attempt to use the r block of code to show a dataframe to the right.
And there we are. In the future I should find if there's a more reproducible solution than just saving the global environment to a data file. Perhaps if I could just be like main.R and then call stuff. But that takes FOREVER to run, so this for now.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
load(file = "practiceData.RData")
aa_freq_df %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```
