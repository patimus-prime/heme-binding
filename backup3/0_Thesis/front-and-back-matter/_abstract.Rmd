TO BE COMPLETED UPON AGREEMENT OF DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION

Metalloproteins compose approximately 40 percent (look up how to do percents in latex) of all known proteins, and use some metallic group to accomplish their chemistry. One such metallic group is heme. Heme is a member of the porphyrin family, which are able to catalyze a broad range of reactions. Heme in particular catalyzes many different reactions and is present in many proteins. However, the underlying structural requirements to host heme in a protein are not well studied.

In this study, all heme or heme-c containing proteins as of xx were downloaded and processed in order to determine underlying structural characteristics these proteins may have in common. Parameters that were examined include: xx. Overall, we found: xx. These results may have implications for protein engineering; or if I fucked up this illustrates the difficulty of the field and demonstrate the wide range of acceptable environments of heme; it may therefore be more appropriate to take a more hands-on approach until perhaps other computational methods evolve to better examine structure-function relationships.
