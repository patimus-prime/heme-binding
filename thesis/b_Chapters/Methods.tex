\chapter{Methods}
	Perhaps I need something right here first?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Download from PDB using the script they’ve provided at RCSB for many, many files
		
		\item Use UCSF Chimera to determine:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Volume
			\item SA
			\item Nearby AA
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item R to process raw data and produce tables
		\item Whatever other software we use to achieve the other results. E.g. E, or availability to solvent etc. likely will stick w Chimera I suspect. Or somehow implement the Python script to open both chimera for the first part of what we’ve done or for something else later. The script we’ve written is a python script, not a chimera script. We’re initializing it with chimera and excluding the necessary code… to initialize chimera and specify chimera to receive the commands
