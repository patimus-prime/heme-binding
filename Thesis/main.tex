% this main.tex largely serves to boot up all the packages and tie the various files together 

% Use book class. Report is an option, but makes sectioning off the front and back matter more difficult. Report more useful for an actual paper v. a thesis, imo based off a quick search
% Further, the book class defaults to assuming this will look like a book. To override this there are two options:
%1:
%\documentclass[openany]{book} %this starts chapters on even pages where appropriate, otherwise it waits for odd
%2:
%\documentclass[oneside]{book} %this sets so that the entire thing is one page

\documentclass[12pt,oneside,a4paper]{book}

% PACKAGES --------------------

% go to packagesmacros.sty to view all packages loaded. subfolders is muy importante
\usepackage{PackagesMacros}
