	*insert the abstract's first paragraph basically here later
	
	In previous work, only ~125 hemoproteins were studied. Although pdbs were thoroughly examined and the datasets were culled, the sample size of this study is very small compared to the amount of hemoproteins available in the pdb a decade later (~10,000 HEM-containing proteins and xx). While not possible to cull as in this study, the additional sample size is of interest to examine for other structural motifs or underlying characteristics.
	
	These characteristics include: xx. They are achieved by either scanning the pdb for them or calculation as detailed below. 
	
	All of these characteristics have implications in the field of protein engineering or basic research into hemoproteins. Examples of the uses of these results include [SUPER BLOOD STUDY] and [OTHER PROTEIN ENGINEERING STUFF]. Not sure how much we can reference those other papers besides doing that besides in the conclusion.
	
	Notable results from some of the prior studies include: xx and xx. These characteristics are also examined in this dataset, while some are not due to different study approaches.
